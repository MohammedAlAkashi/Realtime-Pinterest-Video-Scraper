## Executive Summary

The Pinterest Real-Time Video Discovery Platform represents a sophisticated approach to automated content extraction, leveraging modern web technologies and distributed computing principles. The solution addresses critical performance requirements for enterprise applications demanding instantaneous data retrieval with minimal latency overhead.

## Core Capabilities

### Real-Time Data Streaming
The platform implements a WebSocket-based architecture that enables instantaneous delivery of extracted video URLs as they are discovered during the scraping process. This approach eliminates traditional polling mechanisms and reduces response latency to sub-second intervals, providing immediate data availability for downstream applications.

### Scalable Session Management
The system incorporates intelligent resource allocation through concurrent session handling, allowing multiple parallel extraction operations while maintaining optimal resource utilization. The architecture implements semaphore-based concurrency controls and dynamic load balancing to ensure consistent performance under varying operational loads.

### Enterprise Integration Framework
The platform provides comprehensive integration capabilities through standardized WebSocket protocols, enabling seamless connectivity with modern web applications, mobile platforms, and enterprise systems. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implementation ensures compatibility with diverse client architectures, while Firebase-compatible streaming protocols facilitate integration with cloud-based applications.

### Advanced Data Processing Pipeline
The system implements sophisticated URL transformation algorithms that convert streaming media references to direct download links, optimizing content accessibility for end-user applications. Integrated duplicate detection mechanisms and metadata extraction capabilities ensure data quality and enrichment throughout the processing pipeline.

## Technical Architecture

### Concurrent Processing Framework
The platform implements multi-threaded session handling utilizing semaphore-based resource controls for optimal browser instance lifecycle management. This approach ensures memory-efficient network request capture while maintaining system stability under high-load conditions.

        result_limit: 50
    }
}));

// Process real-time results
connection.onmessage = function(event) {
    const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // Handle extracted content data
};
```
